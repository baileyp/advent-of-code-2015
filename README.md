# Advent of Code!

I found the [Advent of Code][1] via twitter and decided to give it a go. It's a
daily coding challenge in a fun, advent calendar format.

I'll push be pushing my solutions for each day, delayed 3-4 days as to not get
to spoiler-y for anyone watching.

The code I'm writing for these is not fancy. Just whatever I happen to knock
together in the 5-10 minutes I spend on each challenge.

Share your repos [with me][2] if you care to do the same.

**Happy Coding** and **Happy Holidays**!
